JellyTV (current name, open to suggestions)

This is a fork of the original jellyfin-androidtv client with the follwing goals:

1. Remove icon and header text from homescreen (done)
2. Restore libvlc and set as default player so everything can be direct played such as ass subtitles hevc 10 bit videos etc.. (incomplete, hoping for any help from people who actually understand android (mpv may make more sense as it is already working very well in findroid app even on tv))
3. Make sure intro skipper still works with libvlc player after adding it back in. (incomplete)
4. Possibly rename the app so it can be installed along with the official app (done?)
5. Replace screensaver with something dark and simple (so that it doesn't wake me up) like old school colored lines bouncing around the screen (incomplete)
6. Maybe add a way so that app can update itself instead of relying on play store or f-droid similar to the way SmartTube does it (incomplete)
7. Remove telemetry (bug reporting etc..) (incomplete)

If anyone knows how to accomplish any of these things and wishes to contribute please do!


Build instructions and various other things can be found on the offical github page for the jellyfin-androidtv app
